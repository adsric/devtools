## Browser Support

At present, this recipe officially supports the last two versions of the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 9+

This is not to say that it cannot be used with browsers older than those reflected, but merely that the recipe will focus on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.
