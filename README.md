# dploy (WIP)

dploy is a set of tools that combine to form my workflow.

This workflow utilizes the following tools, all of which are independent themselves.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org): for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
- [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com): to automate and enhance the workflow.
- [Bower](http://bower.io): A package manager for front-end dependencies.
