# Workflow (WIP)

A set of tools that combine to form my workflow.

This workflow utilizes the following tools, all of which are independent themselves.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org): for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
- [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com): to automate and enhance the workflow.

1. Run the following: `$ npm install` to install node dependencies

## Automation commands

These are the stand out commands available:-

`$ gulp serve`

`$ gulp`
